## Hosted Website

This website is hosted at https://ethdenver-j394edtds-freeman-jiang.vercel.app

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Notes

You will be unable to deploy the contract unless you have exported your private key in a **.env** file.

To run the application, install the dependencies using `yarn`. Then use `yarn dev` or create an optimized production build using `yarn build` and `yarn start`.

Many features are still under development as this was a hackathon project.
